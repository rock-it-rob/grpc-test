# GRPC Test

This project is a testbed for testing client-server connections using [grpc][1].

## Server

The server module contains the server.

## Client

The client module contains the client.

## Protocol Buffers

Based on the recommendation on the [grpc site][2] I am using proto3 version
of the protocol buffers. Check the main site for more info on
[protocol buffers][3].
